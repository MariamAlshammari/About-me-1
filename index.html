        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Khaled Abu-zenah, Iâ€™m 22 years old, I studied Spanish and English languages at the university of Al Albeit and I live in Ar Rusayfah, I worked in video games translation for six months, which raised my curiosity to learn and know all about programming. Like all humans, I have numerous goals and dreams in my life, like getting a PHD of linguistics and being a professional software developer in addition to be a movies translator, nevertheless, not all of my goals are academic or related to my career, I would hope someday to visit the theatre of dreams Old Trafford and watch a match of my beloved Manchester United there. In my free time, i read books and watch movies, I'm also a video games addict.  </p>
